### What is ARMed?
ARMed is a series of ARM Cortex development boards that I'm currently designing. As time progresses, further additions to the line-up will be made. Along with the board designs, I'm trying to provide helpful ARM assembly language examples as well that will, of course, work with the ARMed boards itself, but can also easily be adapted to other development boards or environments where ARM Cortex MCUs are being used.
